<strong>Schooloscope</strong> was the brainchild of Berg London, a multitalented design studio. Launched in May 2010, the site took performance survey data (Ofsted) about state-run primary and secondary schools and layered it on a map to visualise proximity, size, performance, trends and a whole variety of other parameters. <strong><a href="http://mushon.com/">Mushon Zer-Aviv</a></strong> is a designer, educator and media activist based in NYC says in his <a href="https://visualisingadvocacy.org/blog/should-schools-be-closed-learning-schooloscope-opendata-post-mortem" target="_blank">detailed case study</a>, <em>"Since I first laid my cursor on Schooloscope.com it intrigued me as an exceptional case in the world of open data and information design. The chain of events that led to the siteâ€™s termination is an important story, which I believe should be chronicled and told."</em>
