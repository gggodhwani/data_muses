<a href="http://drones.pitchinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Out of Sight, Out of Mind</a> was inspired by the inadequacies of other attempts to report the effects of an invisibile technological war. Using data from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism we visualized every known attack by the US and Coalition military since 2004 by date, location and number of fatalities.

<strong>Wesley Grubbs</strong> one of the creators from <a href="http://pitchinteractive.com/work/Drones.html" target="_blank">Pitch Interactive</a> states in an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/26/drone-visualization-pakistan_n_2957779.html?ir=India" target="_blank">interview</a> with Huffington Post, <em>"We’re lead to believe that the drone strikes we’re doing in Pakistan and elsewhere in the world have this kind of laser precision—that we’re only getting the bad guys, the imminent threat to Americans. Once we started researching this topic we realized that’s not quite the case."</em>
